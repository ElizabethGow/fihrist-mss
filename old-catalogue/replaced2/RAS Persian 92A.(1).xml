<title xml:lang="per-Latn-x-lc">Tarikh-i Tazah-nawa'i / 'Ata Muhammad, munshi, of Shikarpur.</title>
<note>Written in a florid style.  The first event described is the going into exile of the ruler of Afghanistan Shuja' al-Mulk in 1219.  The last heading introduces an account of a campaign against the Baluch led by the Governor of Sind and 'Ali Murad Khan.  This is evidently Sir Charles Napier's campaign of 1844-5.  The work ends with a diatribe against the corruption of Hindu officials in the service of the English.  The First Afghan War and the conquest of Sind are covered briefly.  Some corrections and marginal additions, presumably by the author. Third flyleaf, recto: two verses.  Verso, poems of Bidil. Fourth flyleaf, recto: verses, some at least by Yusufi. Fifth flyleaf, recto: one line historical note, struck through. Verso: List of rulers of Afghanistan and table of the governors of Shikarpur in each reign. Folio one, recto: title, in Persian. Entered as 92A in handwritten note on the Library's bound copy of Codrington's list.  The first part of the name is there written rather defectively, but Ata is probably intended and he is described as 'Munshi'.  In the Codrington/Reade list this is corrupted to 'Minister' and the name has become 'Ali. The author does not appear to name himself in the text, but two notes by Goldsmid identify him and confirm that this is the author's own MS.  third flyleaf from end, recto: a) MS of the Author (deceased) / History of late Events om Sind and Afghaunistaun / Ali Mahomed Moonshee of Shikarpoor /  This book is perhaps not procurable elsewhere.  I have heard of no other copy; except, it is presumed, with the Author's son.  Ata Mohamed sold me this MS for Rupees 50.  FJG b) Made over to the Royal Asiatic Society.  It was purchased by me about 40 years ago at Shikarpur in Sind.  F J Goldsmid / Hollingbourne, Kent / 2nd January 1893 History of events in Sind and Afghanistan in the first half of the nineteenth century. According to Rieu, title is Tawarikh-i Tazah-nawa'i . The author is the scribe. Headings and punctuation in red.</note>
